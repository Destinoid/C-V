                <h3>Software Development & Design</h3>
                <p>I took I.T seriously when i finished High School, then i enrolled for a Computer Institute (Data-Point). That's when the journey began. I found love for Computer Engineering, then went further into Programming & Web Development. Doing my best to Master my Craft and ever learning. So i'd say, its been God all the way.</p>

                <h3>Gospel Musician</h3>
                <p>Music has been a part of me ever since i was a toddler. I had love for Singing & Musical Instruments. So i joined the Choir, learnt the Drums and Piano (Of which i still play to this present time). I developed myself Vocally also.
                  So as you can see, it wasn't an easy ride. Also had the privilege to work with some Gospel Ministers and grow in Gods Word. I learnt the Guitar along the way, and did my best to be Proficient & Excellent in all. So i consider myself a 
                  <span class="underlined"><strong><em>Versatile</em></strong></span> Musician who loves putting a smile on Gods face.</p>
